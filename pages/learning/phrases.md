This project was inspired by the late Jim Wilson, who presented a collection of Dena'ina phrases and expressions at the 2004 Dena'ina Workshop in Anchorage as a way of helping students learn the language. Jim often gave the students in his Dena'ina language classes a list of phrases to study and memorize at home. This collection provides an opportunity for learners to listen to the phrases and hear the sounds of the language as they read the words.
