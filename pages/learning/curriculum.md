		<h2>Language Teaching Resources</h2>
		
<p>
Unlike most large languages, very few materials have been available for those interesting in teaching the Dena'ina language.  Recently there have been more and more Dena'ina curriculum efforts creating materials. This page is intended to showcase and make available different curriculum efforts and materials for Dena'ina. Those interested in sharing materials on this site should contact <a href="mailto:denaina.qenaga@gmail.com">denaina.qenaga@gmail.com.</a>
</p>
<p>We wish to extend our sincere gratitude to the Elders who have made the development of Dena'ina language curricula  possible: Francis Lindgren, Alexandra Lindgren, Andrew Balluta, Mary Hobson, Mary Delkittie, Agnes Cusma, Pete Bobby, Helen Dick, Fedora Constantine, Nora McCord, Gladys Evanoff, Walter Johnson, Pauline Hobson, and Steve Hobson Jr. (Butch Hobson). We honor and respect you.</p>
