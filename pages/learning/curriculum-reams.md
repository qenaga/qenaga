<h2>Children's Lessons</h2>
<p>The children's lessons incorporate more activities and games into the lessons.  While basic vocabulary such as greetings and numbers are taught, a large number of the lessons use traditional stories as a basis for the lessons.  Below is an excerpt from a lesson using <i>Beluga Story</i></p>
<b>Qunshi Uquch'el'ani Lesson</b><br />
<i>Objective</i>:  TLW (The learner will) gain understanding of Dena’ina sounds, words, story and culture by listening to a Dena’ina story told by Peter Kalifornsky.  TLW demonstrate understanding of the story by retelling and acting out the story.
<i>Materials needed</i>: recording of Peter Kalifornsky telling the "Beluga Story''? from A Dena’ina Legacy: K’TL’EGH’I SUKDU.
Dena’ina coloring book of Beluga story, Blank copy of story for children to illustrate. 
<i>Age</i>: children (2nd - 5th grade)


<ol>
<li>Ask children to sit nearby (Igushla nitsut.)</li>
<li>Introduce speaker and story.  "I am going to share with you a story (Sukdu) from a very important Dena’ina man.  Peter Kalifornsky, one of my uncle’s, shared this story, and many other stories, so our language would be preserved.  This is a book that holds many Dena’ina words and stories.  On the cover is a picture of Peter Kalifornsky.''?</li>
<li>Play tape.</li>
<li>Ask children to act out the story with you.  </li>
<li>Choose characters: hunter,whale, the people (repeat story with different characters)</li>
<li>Hand each child a book without illustrations.  They will illustrate   
      over the course of several days (one page/day) Each day they   
      will listen to the story as they illustrate.  After the first day you 
      could ask them to repeat the phrases they hear, pausing tape to 
      allow them to repeat the phrases. By the time they are done 
      illustrating the book they will be able to correctly pronounce the 
      Dena’ina phrases and read their book on their own.</li>
<li>Conference with each child to see illustrations and listen to their 
      book. Assist them as needed.  Evaluate if they have mastered 
            Dena’ina  pronunciation of the book. </li>
