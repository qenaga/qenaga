# Dena'ina Writers and Speakers

<p>The Dena'ina literary tradition is embodied in the work of a number of important writers and
speakers.
Just as the Greek myths survive due to the efforts of those who first wrote them
down, the Dena'ina literature survives today because of the efforts of writers and speakers who
 recorded or wrote down these stories. This page contains highlights of the work of some important Dena'ina
writers and speakers.</p>

Alaska, writing short stories and identifying place names. He also served as a bilingual teacher in Lime Village, Nondalton, Tyonek and Anchorage.

<p><a name="fitkabalashoff"></a><b>Fitka Balashoff</b> from Seldovia was the primary source for the Seldovia dialect of Dena'ina in the vocabulary recorded by anthropologist Cornelius Osgood in 1931 and 1932.</p>

Village, on the Cook Inlet bluff four miles north of the Kasilof River mouth. Peter’s interest in Dena’ina storytelling began by listening to
another storyteller named <b>Fedore Sasha</b> (1880-1945). By 1974 he was immersed in his writing
projects. He wrote down the <i>sukdu</i>, or traditional stories, as he remembered them. He also began
teaching language classes, first at Wildwood and through Kenaitze Indian Tribe, and later at Kenai

Dena’ina stories and ethnography. He tape-recorded more than seventy hours of narratives and

tape-recorded materials have been transcribed and translated. Some of his knowledge has been
published in <i>Shem Pete's Alaska: The Territory of the Upper Cook Inlet Dena'ina</i>. The depth of his understanding of Dena’ina territory illustrates his remarkable
memory and the strength of Dena’ina culture.</p>

<p><a name="billypete"></a>Shem Pete’s son <b>Billy Pete</b> was born at Susitna Station in 1920, the same day as his cousin,
Sava Stephan. Billy’s grandmother, with whom he spoke in Dena’ina, taught him many of
the traditions, histories, and stories of the Upper Inlet people. His extensive knowledge of Dena’ina culture

father Shem in the preservation of the Upper Cook Inlet Dena’ina culture and history.</p>
