# Dena'ina Placenames

The history of Dena'ina territory and geography is embodied in the Native names for places. All of the important places--rivers, lakes, mountains, lookouts, campsites, small creeks and ponds--have Dena'ina names that were learned by actual experience and memorization. These names represent an ancient and enduring oral tradition.

In the Dene languages, we find that the places are almost never "honorific," named for people. Instead, Dene placenames embody local ecological knowledge of geography and environment. A glimpse into this knowledge can be found in the literal English translations, given in parentheses below. More than two thousand Dena'ina placenames have been documented; a few important names are listed here.
