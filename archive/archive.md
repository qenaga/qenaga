# Welcome to the Dena'ina Qenaga Digital Archive


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/anlc.jpg" align="right">
The Dena'ina Qenaga Archive provides digital access to more than five hundred documents and recordings relating to the Dena'ina language, including nearly everything written in or about Dena'ina language. You may browse or search the available records.  Some of the records have associated digital audio and text files which can downloaded.
In some cases, access restrictions prohibit web-based access to digital materials. However, digital copies may still be available directly from the Alaska Native Language Center.

{: .warning}
We are currently working to restore access to the Archive. In the meantime please visit the [Alaska Native Language Archive](http://www.uaf.edu/anla)
