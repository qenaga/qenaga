speaker: Fedosia Sacaloff 
credit: Recorded in 1975. Published in Shem Pete's Alaska: The Territory of the Upper Cook Inlet Dena'ina, pp. 356-357. University of Alaska Press, 2003. The Dena'ina gave the name tahdna ‘underwater people’ to the first people who arrived in the Inlet by ship. The name later came to be used to refer to the Russians.  This story shows that the Dena'ina have maintained a historical story of the Cook party's arrival in Cook Inlet. The incident in which a dog is shot is strong evidence that the story refers to Cook's party. The story seems to  blend Cook's encounter on the western shore, where the canoes first approached his ships, with his landing at Point Possession, where a dog was shot.
