# qenaga.org

Site code for the Dena'ina Qenaga website (http://qenaga.org), implemented using Jekyll. This rebooting of the qenaga.org project is a work-in-progress. Contributors are welcome.

## History

The Dena'ina Qenaga website as created using ColdFusion as part of the Dena'ina Archiving, Training, and Access Project (2004-2006), a collaboration of the Alaska Native Language Center and the LinguistLIST funded by US National Science Foundation grant OPP-0326805. In January 2017 the archived site was migrated to Lucee, hosted at LinguistLIST. That code can be found on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/linguistlist/qenaga/).
