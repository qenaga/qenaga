## About This Website and the DATA Project

<p>Like the Dena'ina language itself, the Dena'ina Qenaga web site is made possible by the generosity of the Elders. It is through their wisdom and insight that the Dena'ina language has been passed down from generation to generation. We respect, honor and thank you.</p>

<p>Many Dena'ina speakers have contributed materials for this site through contributions to the Alaska Native Language Archive. These include especially Andrew Balluta, whose short story is featured in the <a href="{% link pages/literature/literature.md %}">Literature</a> section, and Alec Balluta &amp; Gladys Evanoff, whose phrase book can be found in the <a href="{% link pages/learning/learning.md %}">Learning</a> section. A more complete list can be found in the <a href="{% link pages/people.md %}">People</a> section. </p>

<p>Several organizations contributed resources to this project. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.uaf.edu/anlc" target="new">Alaska Native Language Center</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.alaskanative.net" target="new">Alaska Native Heritage Center</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.linguistlilst.org" target="new">The LINGUIST List</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.arsc.edu" target="new">Arctic Region Supercomputing Center</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>This web site was conceived under the auspices of the <i>Dena'ina Archiving, Training and Access</i> (DATA) project, pincipal investigator Helen Aristar-Dry (Eastern Michigan University) in collaboration with <a href="http://gmholton.github.io">Gary Holton</a> (Alaska Native Language Center and University of Hawaiâ€˜i).
 The DATA project was a three-year undertaking (2004-2006) to provide online access to Dena'ina language materials housed at the Alaska Native Language Archive to Dena'ina community members. The project also provided training in linguistic fieldwork and best practices in language data digitization and archiving to the Dena'ina community and to students of linguistics.</p>

<p>Site design was overseen by research assistants Sadie Williams and Andrea Berez. Additional assistance was provided by research assistants Olga M&uuml;ller, Michael Christian, Megan Thornley, Joel Hunt,  Zachary Marlow, and Craig Stephenson. </p>


 <p>Jim Kari (Dena'inaq' Titaztunt) provided insight into linguistic and organizational issues (although he is absolved of responsibility for any errors which remain). John Ross and Donita Peter (Alaska Native Heritage Center) and Brett Encelewski (Kenaitze Indian Tribe) provided guidance on intellectual property and access issues. </p>
